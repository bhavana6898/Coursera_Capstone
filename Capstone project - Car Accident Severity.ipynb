But suddenly I see flash of lightening outside, hear the roaring thunder and the pitter-patter of rain drops. Everyone gets dissappointed as the elders start advising that it is not safe to drive in such conditions. We cancel the plan. \nHowever, we cannot do the same if it is an urgent meeting you have to attend or catch a flight for an important business oppurtunity overseas. Because the elders are just making vague predictions based on their experience. It is coorect to a certain extent but these appointments cannot be missed based on predictions made with no certain proof.\n\nThus, this project focuses on bulding a Machine Learning Model to predict the safety of the travellers (i.e) the probability of an accident to occur based on various factors including weather, road conditions, traffic, etc. It helps make more accurate predictions based on the data collected from different accident locations in Seattle.\n\nThe information gathered by performing Data Analysis on the collected data will help the police forces and emergency medical evcuation team to warned and be prepared for being able to reach the location that are accident-prone areas.\nIf found that the state of the roads are being a major cause for accidents, then the public works department can be notified about the amendments to be made for safe travel."

The aim of the model is to find the dependency of severity of the accident on the factors like age of the driver, location of accident, whether the driver was under influence or not.\n\nI have the accident data downloaded as **Data-Collisions.csv**, which includes all types of collisions. Collisions will display at the intersection or\nmid-block of a segment. Timeframe: 2004 to Present.
